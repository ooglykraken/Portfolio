					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						Katabasis is a top-down puzzle game. You play as a boy who's lost in this strange dungeon. At first he's scared when the lights go out but the lantern he finds gives him the courage to descend further, perhaps to an exit. I'm working with 6 others to finish this game. We have two programmers (counting myself), two musicians, and one artist. I'm the project lead in addition to programming. Every one is a part of the game design so it's very much a democratic environment.

					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						This is called Schmup which is a play on "Shoot'em up". It is a top down vertical space shooter in the vein of Galaxian as an infinite runner. As a scout returning from a ranging you are ambushed by the Schmup Empire. You can score points but you probably won't make it home. My next update for this will allow for score keeping even online.

					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						TDD is a mash-up of Tower Defense and Dungeons and Dragons fantasy. The player places automaton heroes on the path to stop creeps from making it to the village and destroying it. There are 8 heroes based on traditional fantasy "Classes" each with unique skills and stats. This was a solo project I started early on to learn unity, design, and game programming. There is no art for enemies, the background is still a mockup, there is no balancing yet, the characters have incomplete ability sets, and there is one or two UI bugs.
