					I have three active/major projects right now. But I've also included a prototype that has provided a lot of insight into development and design.

					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						Katabasis is a top-down adventure game similar to the Legend of Zelda or Binding of Isaac but with an emphasis on puzzle solving and the dichotomy of light and dark. You play as a boy who's lost in this strange dungeon. At first he's scared when the lights go out but the lantern he finds gives him the courage to descend further, perhaps to an exit. I'm working with six others to finish this game. We have two programmers (counting myself), two musicians, and one artist but everyone is involved in design. This has created a strongly collaboritive environment where opinions are expressed freely and game design is more democratic.

					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						Water Works is a project from Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs. I was hired on after the previous developer left so I could help finish it. It is an isometric city builder except the focus is entirely on developing a working water system. The player is able to lay pipes, watertowers, residential areas, treatment plants and more to create a thriving community. Truly the focus of the project is to see if games can influence people's understanding of a topic and if they adjust their behavior accordingly. Obviously our topic is modern water systems so we hope that by playing our game people will understand how important this topic is and will adjust their behavior to create a positive change in water usage.

						This project received some attention from the <a href="http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/news/team-designing-game-to-teach-water-usage-management/" target="_blank">school newspaper</a>

					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						This is called Schmup which is a play on "Shoot'em up". It is a top down vertical space shooter in the vein of Galaxian though as an infinite runner. As a scout returning from a ranging you are ambushed by the Schmup Empire. You can score points but you probably won't make it home. This game is unique to me because it is something I plan to work on and add to over time. New features in mind are a complete scoring system, boss fights, new weapons, and more intelligent enemy behaviors.

					<span class="GameDescription">
						<p>
						TDD is a mash-up of Tower Defense and Dungeons and Dragons fantasy. The player places automaton heroes on the path to stop creeps from making it to the village and destroying it. There are 8 heroes based on traditional fantasy "Classes" each with unique skills and stats. This was a solo project I started early on to learn unity, design, and game programming. There is no art for enemies, the background is still a mockup, there is no balancing yet, the characters have incomplete ability sets, and there is atleast one UI bug. I've been told not to include incomplete/ugly projects like this but I learned so much from this I felt obliged to include it.
