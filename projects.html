However after pitching the concept and showing what I had already several others were eager to join and Katabasis becaming something greater. Initially the games focus was on portraying depression however with increased team size our scope could be greater. Thus instead we molded our game around the Kubler-Ross model.

							Water Works is a project from Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs. I was hired on after the previous developer left so I could help finish it. It is an isometric city builder except the focus is entirely on developing a working water system. The player is able to lay pipes, watertowers, residential areas, treatment plants and more to create a thriving community. Truly the focus of the project is to see if games can influence people's understanding of a topic and if they adjust their behavior accordingly. Obviously our topic is modern water systems so we hope that by playing our game people will understand how important this topic is and will adjust their behavior to create a positive change in water usage.
							</p>
							<p>
							This project received some attention from the <a href="http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/news/team-designing-game-to-teach-water-usage-management/" target="_blank">school newspaper</a>
							</p>
							<p>
							This is a rather large project and it probably won't be finished before I graduate but I plan on helping as much as I can for as long as I can.

							I was contracted by Seven Jets Games to develop this game in a month. Max, my contact at Seven Jets, told me the game was a sidescrolling shooter that grew in difficulty for four minutes. At four minutes it was supposed to be extremely difficult for the player to survive. First I was asked to propose a plan for development over the 30 day work time. I sent my proposal and immediately began working after getting the ‘ok’.
							</p>
							<p>
							Immediately I started with the player character. The next day I was given most of the art, sound effects, and UI. In favor of creating a Minimum Viable Product before following my proposal exactly I added some of these basic art assets. Next I designed and programmed several enemy behaviors. By the end of the first week I had the player character, the scrolling background, and three enemies in the game. Because of our time difference I provided updates to Max in small videos with commentary detailing each aspect of the game I had worked on. He provided feedback and I adjusted my work around it.
							</p>
							<p>
							Planning the enemy spawning system was the first thing I started in week two. Since the difficulty had a cap at four minutes I used the game’s run time % 240 seconds to derive what ratio of four minutes the player has survived. I generate a number proportional to this value and run it through a switch of enemy values. Each enemy has a value from 1(easiest) to 100(most difficult), the highest enemy value smaller than the rolled number is deducted from the roll and I go back through the switch again til the role is 0. After getting most of this done I finished the rest of the enemies to test the spawning more thoroughly.
							</p>
							<p>
							Week three’s priorities were re-doing the scrolling background and adding music which took little time. With all of the enemies in place it became much easier to finish the spawner and debug enemy behaviors. My last day of development I finally got an android device to deploy and test on and I finished all of the UI that day. Then I prepped the Google Play store for release and sent my most current build along to Max.

							Schmup was the first game I finished at Plow during my internship. After about a week of working on a myriad of game demo’s my supervisor asked me to make something with a Sample Project, so I took all the art and sounds and started a new project.  The first thing I worked on was creating the player character, then programming and refining movement. To make things interesting I wrote an attack function for shooting projectiles. This took some effort as it was my first time working with generating projectiles, propelling them in the desired direction, and then reacting with the proper behavior.							
							</p>
							<p>
							This is when my supervisor stepped in and had me learn xml so I could create adjustable files for the waves of enemies in the game. So we implemented an XML reader and wrote “waves” in the xml that are numbered and would be randomly spawned when ready. The whole thing runs on an object pool that recycles the background tiles and enemies while the player character flies forward.
							</p>
							<p>
							One thing that was in the sample project were asteroids, I added these and had them damage the player and enemies on hit. At this point the character was dying very quickly so I gave them a three-hit health bar and temporary invulnerability after getting hit. To provide some more layers to the combat I gave the asteroids a random chance to explode over a decent radius. As I had hoped this could chain and wipe out a wave of ships, asteroids, and all. This could also unexpectedly hit the player, to counter this I gave the character a regenerating shield.
							</p>
							<p>
							Now all that was left was to give it some more features like lives which I called “Reassemblies” so as to give in-game meaning to the unrealistic ability of a spaceship to be graced by god with another life, good as new. I call them reassemblies to allude to some sort of futuristic technology that allows the ship to re-assimilate after too much structural damage, the caveat being limited uses (like lives), using nano-technology. Then I added a score system to give some sense of progression for each run.

							The game I have retro-actively dubbed “Mario Bird” is a project that I was asked to do at Plow. What they really wanted was something like FlappyBird to be added as a mini-game to the already-released Endless Blitz. However since its something I can conjure in a few hours I decided to have fun with it and tailor it to my supervisor’s affection for Nintendo.
							</p>
							<p>
							While relatively simple to make it requires an intelligent approach as much as any game. In this game where the character physics determines not only how it feels to play but also how challenging it is. So the very first thing I did was program a ballot always move forward and have some gravity to fall. Then I made it so it jumps when you tap.  I took some time to fine-tune the falling speed, jump height, and the acceleration from the jump. Then I started working on an object pooling system for the in-game obstacles.
							</p>
							<p>
							This part provided some challenge in having random heights and fixed spacing without being nearly impossible. In beating that challenge though I created obstacles that are challenging enough to end a run but never impossible to pass. The object pool creates all of the obstacles which are pairs covering the top and bottom. They are always created at a certain distance but the heights are adjusted so the passable gap varies randomly. Since the character is always moving forward once the obstacles pass out of the camera’s view they are prepared for the next placement.
							</p>
							<p>
							After all of this I spent more time adjusting colliders, gravity, speeds, spawning, and just about everything else til I was satisfied. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Then the fun started. Since I keep all of my GameObjects as abstract as possible it was just a matter of adding the song, sprites, and sound effects to the right GameObjects. This way my supervisor could easily adjust and change the game once it was ported into Endless Blitz.

							TDD is a mash-up of Tower Defense and Dungeons and Dragons fantasy. The player places automaton heroes on the path to stop creeps from making it to the village and destroying it. There are 8 heroes based on traditional fantasy "Classes" each with unique skills and stats. This was a solo project I started early on to learn unity, design, and game programming. There is no art for enemies, the background is still a mockup, there is no balancing yet, the characters have incomplete ability sets, and there is atleast one UI bug. I've been told not to include incomplete/ugly projects like this but I learned so much from this I felt obliged to include it.
							</p>
							<p>
							I really liked this concept but the design work was far too ambitious for my skill at the time. However having started it I learned alot about design and it gave me a good excuse to really push my coding skills (just the script for all of the heroes is over 2000 lines). It taught me how to best manage having Update and FixedUpdate in Unity. Not only that but in a game like this UI is very important thus it was really my first exposure tos UI design and coding. Unfortunately I haven't worked up the courage to fix all of the present bugs and get it to a better state of running but I'm still proud of this since it was really the first game I tried to create.
