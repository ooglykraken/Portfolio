				<li>Description: Katabasis is a game of great pride for me and the player script has evolved a tremendous amount since the game started, this is the current version.</li>

				<li>Project Title: Mario Bird</li>
				<li>Description: I learned so many things at Plow, one technique was Object Pools. This includes the object pool that was written for Mario Bird. I chose this because it was concise and another example of JavaScript, honestly one of my first times writing in it. To see it used in-game look at the gameplay script, it shows how the object pool is used in the infinitely scrolling iteration of the world.</li>

				<li>Description: A second important technique I learned at Plow, truly the first I was taught, was using singletons.</li>

				<li>Project Title: WaterWorks</li>
				<li>Description: This script for WaterWorks contains some of the most complex logic I've had to write so far. This particular one handles all of the gameplay and the interaction with the different modules of the game like cookies and talking to the database scripts. However what truly made this a beast was re-writing the logic for real-time water flow through the pipes. This required a lot of lean iteration and logical simplification. The limited stack size on the web and the amount of information that constantly needed to be processed (once a second exactly) constrained implementation to something smart, adaptive, and faultless.</li>

				<li>Project Title: Town Defense & Dragons</li>
				<li>Description: Early examples of troublesome scripts are the Hero and the the Enemy Scripts from Town Defense and Dragons. They needed to understand the state of the battlefield to prioritize the right units, use abilities, and in the heroes' case level up.</li>
