					<h3>
						I grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana with my two siblings, my parents, and a menagerie of animals. I've played just about every sport under the American sun but only wrestling kept my interest. Starting in elementary school at some time I wrestled every year sometimes two seasons a year through High School. I never met the goals I set for myself in wrestling but I used that experience to branch into Mixed Martial Arts which I still pursue. 
					</h3>
					
					<h3>
					When I'm not doing that I also like to go hiking/backpacking, kayaking, fishing, rock climbing, and just exploring the vast world we live in. This includes general traveling too. I just spent this past winter ('16) in China with my girlfriend and her family.  
					</h3>
										
					<h3>
					At this point you're probably thinking to yourself "Do you even play games?". That is a very justifiable thought. What I like to do most is just pick a comfortable spot and log in a few hours in an entertaining game. Or strike up some competitive yet often ridiculous games of Magic: the Gathering.
					</h3>
					
					<h3>
					I'm very open about what games I play (rather I try to be). So I don't always stick to one genre though there are some visible patterns in what I play.
