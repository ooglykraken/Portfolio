				<!--As you probably know my name is Ian Ford. I am currently working towards my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at IU. Some might consider me a little eccentric but I don’t see anything wrong with that. Of course I’m an avid gamer and have been since my brother bought a Nintendo 64. My approach to artistic media is that I’ll enjoy whatever I think is good and try not to stick too much to any one genre. For example a couple of my favorite games are Dark Souls II (probably my favorite), Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, Devil May Cry 3, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Each has it’s own merits and qualities that appeal to me such as DMC 3’s skill based gameplay and Banjo’s sense of humor. My buddies and I also love to play Magic: the Gathering and fighting games like Street Fighter. When it comes to music I listen to just about everything from metal to hip-hop to classical. My dad is quite the outdoorsman so I’ve done everything from canoeing the Boundary waters to backpacking the Talkeetna Mountains in Alaska. I’ve traveled to just about every state in the country and have been out of it once or twice. Just about any sport you can find in America I’ve tried but the only one I stuck with was wrestling. I wrestled varsity all four years in high school and was team captain my senior year. Because I took wrestling so seriously (diet is very important) and my mom is a cook I started cooking in high school and now consider myself a somewhat accomplished chef. To potential employers I hope this either does nothing to affect your opinion of me or that it improves it. To everyone else I hope you found this short auto-biography interesting and enlightening.

				I'm currently attending Indiana University for a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My work includes Game Development at Plow Games/Plow Digital as well as helping Professor of Practice Mike Sellers in prototyping game ideas. He brought me along to help him with development of Water Works in Fall '15.
