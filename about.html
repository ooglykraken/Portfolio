					<h3>
					I grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana with my two siblings, my parents, and a menagerie of animals. I've played just about every sport under the American sun but only wrestling kept my interest. Now I like to pursue mixed martial arts like jiu-jitsu and boxing.
					</h3>
					
					<h3>
					When I'm not doing that I also like to go hiking/backpacking, kayaking, fishing, rock climbing, and just exploring the vast world we live in. This includes general traveling too. I just spent this past winter ('16) in China with my girlfriend and her family.

					<h3>
					"What about the games?" I really like challenging games, games that have a rewarding skill curve. A good example is fighting games. Didn't really like them until a friend introduced me to Marvel vs. Capcom. The gameplay was immediately rewarding enough for me to want to learn how to do really stylish team combos. This is one of the reasons I liked Devil May Cry, the more I put into learning it the more I enjoyed it. Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, and more all have this kind of rewarding feedback that isn't an extension of the game but personal sense of accomplishment or satisfaction. Magic: The Gathering is similar as well, the rules are very strict but the way cards break them allow for great freedom of strategy and the ability to litigate the consequences. By learning the rules and understanding the way the cards use (or not use) them creates the potential for approaches that appeal to you.
