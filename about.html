					I started making custom games in Warcraft III map editor when I was in high school. A few years later in college I started trying to make a game in Unity. This was TDD, which is playable from here. Around this time I joined Hoosier Games which is student run group at Indiana University helping students form development teams and create a network of fellows and peers. My first semester with HG put me on a team for Robots vs. Robots as a programmer. Unfortunately due to a lack of direction among other issues the game was never finished. However my experience earned me an internship at Plow Games in Indianapolis.

					Under my supervisor's guidance I quickly familarized myself with Unity3D. While there I ended up working on digital game guides for Brady Games, VR and AR plugins for Unity, doing level design for Build-a-Bear Merry Mission, mini-game development for Endless Blitz, as well as creating half a dozen small games and demoes for practice. After Plow I felt confident enough to attempt my own game again. It started out as a small mobile game that I could make in a small amount of time. However after a pitch to HG six others showed interest and joined the team, pushing the game into something much more. Right now the game is in open beta on itch.io and I plan on finishing it this year.

					Discontent to let my skills rust I approached the now-professor of practice Mike Sellers for work opportunities. He decided to hire me to help him prototype his game ideas. This arrangement lasted two semesters and during this time we made some headway in development of a 4x style strategy game in which we hoped players could take a civilization through history with the opportunity to discover any technology at any time. After this Mike invited me to join him on the Waterworks team to replace the recently departed developer. While on this project I've really had to push my understanding and skill of complex system design and implementation. During the beginning of 2016 I worked with Seven Jets Games to create Zero Wing in 30 days. They provided me with a simple design concept, art, and music then I put it all together. After all of that I was graced with an internship at Marvel games on their production team.
