				<!--As you probably know my name is Ian Ford. I am currently working towards my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at IU. Some might consider me a little eccentric but I don’t see anything wrong with that. Of course I’m an avid gamer and have been since my brother bought a Nintendo 64. My approach to artistic media is that I’ll enjoy whatever I think is good and try not to stick too much to any one genre. For example a couple of my favorite games are Dark Souls II (probably my favorite), Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, Devil May Cry 3, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Each has it’s own merits and qualities that appeal to me such as DMC 3’s skill based gameplay and Banjo’s sense of humor. My buddies and I also love to play Magic: the Gathering and fighting games like Street Fighter. When it comes to music I listen to just about everything from metal to hip-hop to classical. My dad is quite the outdoorsman so I’ve done everything from canoeing the Boundary waters to backpacking the Talkeetna Mountains in Alaska. I’ve traveled to just about every state in the country and have been out of it once or twice. Just about any sport you can find in America I’ve tried but the only one I stuck with was wrestling. I wrestled varsity all four years in high school and was team captain my senior year. Because I took wrestling so seriously (diet is very important) and my mom is a cook I started cooking in high school and now consider myself a somewhat accomplished chef. To potential employers I hope this either does nothing to affect your opinion of me or that it improves it. To everyone else I hope you found this short auto-biography interesting and enlightening.

					I started making custom games in Warcraft III map editor when I was in high school. A few years later in college I started trying to make a game in Unity. This was TDD, which is playable from here. Around this time I joined Hoosier Games which is student run group at Indiana University helping students form development teams and create a network of fellows and peers. My first semester with HG put me on a team for Robots vs. Robots as a programmer. Unfortunately due to a lack of direction among other issues the game was never finished. However my experience earned me an internship at Plow Games in Indianapolis.

					Under my supervisor's guidance I quickly familarized myself with Unity3D. While there I ended up working on digital game guides for Brady Games, VR and AR plugins for Unity, doing level design for Build-a-Bear Merry Mission, mini-game development for Endless Blitz, as well as creating half a dozen small games and demoes for practice. After Plow I felt confident enough to attempt my own game again. It started out as a small mobile game that I could make in a small amount of time. However after a pitch to HG six others showed interest and joined the team, pushing the game into something much more. Right now the game is in open beta on itch.io and I plan on finishing it this year.

					Discontent to let my skills rust I approached the now-professor of practice Mike Sellers for work opportunities. He decided to hire me to help him prototype his game ideas. This arrangement lasted two semesters and during this time we made some headway in development of a 4x style strategy game in which we hoped players could take a civilization through history with the opportunity to discover any technology at any time. After this Mike invited me to join him on the Waterworks team to replace the recently departed developer. While on this project I've really had to push my understanding and skill of complex system design and implementation. During the beginning of 2016 I worked with Seven Jets Games to create Zero Wing in 30 days. They provided me with a simple design concept, art, and music then I put it all together. After all of that I was graced with an internship at Marvel games on their production team.
